# Code Challenge - Amazonia
## Solution built with React + TypeScript + Vite

Install:
```sh
pnpm install
```

Run dev:
```sh
pnpm dev
```

Run tests:
```ts
pnpm run test
```

## My main dificulties:
1. The first dificulty was to find the correct data structure for the API Response and to choose the right algorithm! I didn't remember about the Dijkstra Algorithm, so I had to do some research
2. Second one was to develop the Board as a whole, it's separeted components were not hard to create, but the whole thing together was a little bit toilsome!
   
## Final Thoughs
I had a lot of fun doing this challenge, especially by developing the board, the icon components and using beautifull algorithm like Dijkstra together with a "fun to interact" interface like this board.
